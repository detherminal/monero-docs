title: MyMonero Mnemonic Scheme
---

The MyMonero scheme can be thought as the 13-word version of the [Legacy Mnemonic Scheme](./legacy.md). It was initially used by MyMonero web and mobile wallet, but other projects also adopted this scheme. The scheme is designed to be more user-friendly and easier to remember than the legacy scheme. The MyMonero scheme is also compatible with the legacy scheme, meaning that you can restore a wallet generated by the legacy scheme using the MyMonero scheme and vice versa.

The MyMonero scheme comprises a total of 13 words, where the first 12 words are for the seed and the last word is for the checksum. The checksum word is used to verify the correctness of the seed.

Deriving checksum process is the same as the [Legacy Mnemonic Scheme](./legacy.md), you can check out the details from that page.
